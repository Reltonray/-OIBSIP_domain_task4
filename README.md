Network Security Threats: DoS, MITM, and Spoofing





Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
 

Visualize this: a DoS attack is as if a person spamming the phone line at a shop so real customers cannot make a call through. The attacker floods a system with so many false requests that it does not work or crawls to a stop. Now, if they're bombarding it from an army of hijacked computers—called a botnet—that's a DDoS attack, and it's even nastier.
Why it matters: These attacks can take sites down, disrupt business, and destroy a company's reputation.
Real-world example: In 2021, the Associated Press had a DDoS attack launched against them that took their site down for a period. Total chaos.






Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
 

Imagine this: a hacker intruding on a private chat between you and your friend, listening in, and even changing what they're talking about—without you or your friend ever knowing. That's an MITM attack.

How they do it:

ARP Spoofing: They trick your network into sending information to their machine.
DNS Spoofing: They alter domain records to redirect you to spoof sites.
SSL Stripping: They hijack secure HTTPS connections and turn them into plain HTTP. Sneaky, indeed.
What's the harm? Hijacked passwords jacked bank accounts, or hijacked sessions.
Real-world example: In 2008, Colombian soldiers reportedly used an MITM trick to intercept messages and conduct a hostage rescue. Wild stuff.







Spoofing Attacks
 

Spoofing is when the bad guy pretends to be someone you trust to deceive you. Think of a con man pretending to be someone's identity.

Common tricks:

Email Spoofing: Sending emails that pretend to come from your boss or bank.
IP Spoofing: Hiding their true IP address to look legitimate.
Caller ID Spoofing: Faking a phone number so you think it's somebody you know.
What's the danger? Stolen data, illegal access, or malware sneaking onto your device.
Real-world illustration: As far back as 1997, security specialists showed exactly how spoofed sites might collect personal information. It's been a problem forever.


How to Remain Secure

Against DoS/DDoS:
Restrict the number of requests an individual source can make (rate limiting).
Use CDNs or DDoS protection specifically designed for such purposes to absorb the blow.

Against MITM:
Always access HTTPS websites that support decent SSL/TLS encryption.
Encrypt your Wi-Fi and use a VPN.

Against Spoofing:
Enable mail protections like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to identify the fakes.
Practice and train your team to recognize suspicious mails and phishing attacks.

Wrapping It Up
Cyberattacks like DoS, MITM, and spoofing constantly change, but so do the ways to fight them. Lock your systems down with solid security, keep your software updated, and keep your wits about you to identify scams. That will make you a tough nut to crack
